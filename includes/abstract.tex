\indent Image processing is a field that has many application in life. It can be from the usual application to the application in medicine or cosmology. To obtain the best result, all most of applications must follow two processes: Firstly,  we involve primitive operations such as reduce noise, contrast enhancement or image sharpening. Secondly, we can apply the segmentation, description the objects to a form suitable for application process and classification of individual object.\\[0.3cm]
\indent The goal of project is built a program with full functions about image processing. During my internship at LaBRI, my task is studying the architecture and program of last application, what was developed by NGUYEN Hoang Thao. I also develop an algorithm to preprocessing image, programming of automatic classification methods applied to biological images and integrated into last program. Besides, we also debug the code and write the documentation for the next development.
