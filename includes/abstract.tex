\indent Image processing is a field that has many application in life. It can be from the usual application to the application in medicine or cosmology. To obtain the best result, all most of applications must follow two processes: Firstly, we involve primitive operations such as reduce noise, contrast enhancement or image sharpening. Secondly, we can apply the segmentation, description the objects to a form suitable for application process and classification of individual object.\\[0.3cm]
\indent The goal of project is built a program with full functions about processing base on the biological images. During my internship at LaBRI, my tasks are developing the algorithm to preprocessing image and programming of automatic classification methods applied to biological images. After finsihed, I integrated it into the IMP tool, which was developed by NGUYEN Hoang Thao. Besides, we also debug the previous code and write the documentation for the next development.
