\indent Image processing is a field that has many applications in life. It could be the usual application or the applications in medicine or cosmology. To obtain the best result,most of the applications must follow two processes: firstly, pre-processing the images with some appropriate operators to enhance the interest and to reduce the noises. Secondly, applying the main operations to obtain the result.\\[0.2cm]
\indent The goal of this project to build the program fully functional program about processing base on the biological images. During my internship at LaBRI, my tasks was developing the algorithm to automatic identify the landmarks of the biological images and to classify the biological images. The method based on the morphometry in image processing.\\[0.2cm]
\indent Finally, I integrated my functions into the Image Processing for Morphometrics (IPM) software, which was developed by NGUYEN Hoang Thao. Besides, we also debug the previous code and write the documentation for the next phases.
