\indent Image processing is a field that has many applications in life. It could be useful to extract the information and knowledge about phenomena as medical or biological processes. To obtain the best result, most of the applications must follow two processes: firstly, pre-processing the images with some appropriate operators to enhance the interest and to reduce the noises. Secondly, applying the measures or classification procedures to obtain the main results.\\[0.2cm]
\indent The goal of this project is to build the program fully functional program about processing base on the biological images in the context of Morphometry. During my internship at LaBRI, my tasks was developing the algorithm to automatic identify the landmarks of the biological images and to classify a set of beetle in 2D dimensions. The method based on the probabilistic Hough transform. The article is \textbf{``Automatic identification of landmarks in digital images"}.\\[0.2cm]
\indent At the end of the internship, I integrated the implementation of the article into the Image Processing for Morphometrics (MorphoEcol) software, which was developed previously by NGUYEN Hoang Thao (another PUF Master Degree). Besides, we also debug the previous code and write the documentation for the next phases.
