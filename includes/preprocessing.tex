\chapter{Preprocessing image}
\section{Problem}
Preprocessing data is a stage that we remove the noises and unexpected objects on image. To obtain the good result when applying the automatic classification methods. In this chapter, we suggest a method preprocessing image.\\[0.2cm]
With the input is a set of 293 images. Each image contains the parts of insect and an unexpected object, specifically yellow grid (figure \ref{fig:figure_31}). The method proposed to remove the yellow grid and keep the insect on the image.

\end{figure}
\section{Analysis}
Each input image contains the two objects: a part of insect (called insect) and the yellow grid (called grid). About the relative position, the grid always stayed in the left of insect, and insect can either overlap the grid. About the color, image is presented in BGR model with three main color groups: the background color, the yellow color of grid and the color of insect.\\[0.2cm]
The method proposed to remove the grid based on the color processing. If we process the image in BGR model, the algorithm may be complex because the color at each pixel is combined of three values (blue, green, red). While HSV model has a specific channel to present the colors with clear range. We can apply this property for detecting and removing the gird. The proposed process to remove  the grid as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the ``\textit{limit}" point of grid: the points stay nearest outside grid.
\item Find the ``\textit{replace}" point: location that its value used to replace for grid.
\item Replace the grid by the value at ``\textit{replace}" point.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Finding the limiting and the replacing point}
Browsing image to check and replace the pixels in gird need a long time. To reduce the time to do that, we should find the limit range of grid. The limit of gird is the points located out of gird and its closest. Instance of checking on all pixel, we just check the pixels stay on the left of limit points.\\
As we know, the width of grid usually less than a two-thirds of width of image. So, to reduce the time to finding the limit point, we also check from the begin of image to two-thirds of image. The result of this step is the limit points, these used for limiting the length when we check the pixels on yellow grid.\\
\textbf{The algorithm to find the limit points are followed:}\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\Indm
\KwData{$inputImage$: The input image (contains the insect and grid)}
\KwResult{The coordinate of limit point}
\Indp
Declare some variables: $Mat$ $hsvImage$; $vector<Mat> hsv\_channel$\;
Convert image from BGR to HSV: $cv:cvtColor(inputImage, hsvImage, COLOR\_BGR2HSV)$ \;
Split HSV image into several channel: $cv::split(hsvImage, hsv\_channels)$\;
Set up initial \textit{limit\_point} and assign with the left-top corner: $Point$ $limit\_point = Point(0,0)$\;
Declare a variable $yellow\_count$ to count the number yellow points on each columns when processing. An column become a limit line if the number of yellow points on this column less than a constant value.\;
\For{$j \leftarrow 10 $ \KwTo $hsv\_channel[0].cols$}{
	\If{H value at $(5,j) > $ 100 \textbar \textbar (H  value at $(5,j) > 70$ $\&\&$ H value at $(5,j) < 100$\\
				$\&\&$ S value at $(5,j) < 10 $ $\&\&$ V value at $(5,j) > 175$ )
		}{
		$limit\_point.x \leftarrow j$\;
		$limit\_point.y \leftarrow 0$\;
		$yellow\_count \leftarrow 0 $\; 
		\For{$i \leftarrow 1 $ \KwTo $hsv\_channel[0].rows * 2/3$}{
			\If{H value at $(i,j) <= 38 $}{
				$yellow\_count++$\;
				\If{$yellow\_count >= 8$}{
					$limit\_point.x \leftarrow 0$\;
					$limit\_point.y \leftarrow 0$\;		
					break\;	
				}		
			}
		}
		\If{$limit\_point.x != 0$}{
			break\;
		}
	}
}
\If{$limit\_point.x == 0$}{
	$limit\_point.x \leftarrow hsv\_channel[0].columns/3 + 200$\;
	$limit\_point.y \leftarrow 0$\;	
}

\end{algorithm}~~\\
Now, we indicate which is the color used to replace the yellow points. Hence, we choose the points having the value nearest with the background color. The histogram is ideal for choosing the position to replace, but we also have some conditions to obtain a good value.\\
The algorithm to find the replacing points are 
followed:\\

\KwResult{The coordinate of replacing point}
\Indp

Split the HSV image into channels\;
\For{$i \leftarrow 0 $ \KwTo $grayImage.rows$}{
		\For{$j \leftarrow 0 $ \KwTo $grayImage.columns$}{
		\If{value at $(i,j) > $mean of histogram\\
			$\&\&$ H value (i,j) $>$ 90\\
			$\&\&$ H value (i,j) $>$ 130\\
			$\&\&$ S value at (i,j) $>$ 50\\
			$\&\&$ V value at (i,j) $>$ 215 }{
			return this position \;
		}
	}
}

\subsection{Replacing the grid}
After having the limit points. By processing on all rows of image. At each row, we replace the pixels which have the color value stay in the range of yellow by another value. But the grid is not only created by the yellow point, it contains more the pixel have the value stay in the same range with background. But the brightness of these pixels is less than the background. So, we needs to replace it obtained the good image. In each row, this work repeated until meeting the limit points or a ``special point" (called ``break" point). It can be a point stayed on the insect or a point belong to background.\\
For each part of the insect, the color on insect or the background also have the difference value. So, we establish the difference values for each part. Based on the file name of image, we can classify it.\\
\IncMargin{1em}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\Indm
\KwData{filePath: the file path of image}
\KwResult{Which part of insect in image}
\Indp
\textit{QString} temp $\leftarrow$ filePath.toLower()\;
\If{temp contains ``ely"}{
	return ELYTRE\;
}
\If{temp contains ``md"}{
	return MDROITE\;
}
\If{temp contains ``mg"}{
	return MGAUCHE\;
}
\If{temp contains ``prono"}{
	return PRONOTUM\;
}
\If{temp contains ``tete"}{
	return TETE\;
}
return ELYTRE\;
