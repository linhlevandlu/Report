Morphometry is a concept refers to qualitative analysis of form, it includes the size and the shape of an object. Mophormetry analyses are commonly performed on organism. An objective of morphometry is to statistic hypotheses based on the effect of shape.
In image processing, morphometry can be used to detect the shape, size or changes in form on family organism. Generally, to measure the object's morphometry, we can use one of three morphometry forms: traditional morphometry, landmark-based geometric morphometry, outline-based morphometry.  

In this internship, we consider landmark-base geometric morphometry. And our goal is to implement the methods to extract the landmarks automatically from biological images as well as calculate some statistics to comparing results.

The whole report has five chapters. In the first chapter, this is the short introduction about the context working as well as the objectives of my internship. Chapter 2, introduces the necessary preliminaries in image processing field which we use to implement the methods. In the third chapter, this is the mainly chapter of report. We mention method to extract the landmarks automatically from the biological images.In the chapter 4, we will focus on the design of software. This chapter introduces the architecture and explain the model of software. Finally, chapter 5, we will introduce the result and our experimentation. Besides, we give a short summary about the work and describe about the future work.
