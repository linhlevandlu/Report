\chapter{Result}
The examination based on a machine equipped with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU 3.6GHz, 16 GB of RAM. For each dataset, it includes 293 images(3264 x 2448). 
The landmarks estimated automatically based on two method: \textit{cross-corrlelation} (called method 1) and \textit{the proposed method} (called method 2). And the result obtained from the method 2 is better than the result from the method 1.
