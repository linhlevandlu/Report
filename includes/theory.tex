\section{Overview about image processing}
We have a lot of programs what used to edit the photos (e.g. photoshop, gimp, paint,...). By apply some technique, we can effectively some property to change the image such as: scaling image, blurring image, rotating image,.... We also know that, an image is a set of pixels. Each pixel have a value that present for the color at this location, and its location was indicated by coordinates in two-dimension.. When combine the value of all pixels, we have the image as we can see in the real word. The changing on image really changing the value on each pixel in image. Behind the techniques in the programs are mathematical operations and the field using mathematical operation on an input image,  called \textit{image processing}. The output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics related to the image. And most of image processing technique are performed on two-dimensional image.
