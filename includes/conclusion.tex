\indent The landmarks are important characteristics used in shape analysis of many biological and medical applications. The method proposed in this internship report can be used to estimate the landmarks on biological images. These estimated landmarks can be compared with the result estimated by cross-correlation.\\[0.2cm]
\indent After finishing the internship, we have implemented the proposed method by using the OpenCV library and the Qt framework on C++. And the test was done on two set of biological images: \textit{right mandible and left mandible}. But we can try to implement by using other methods. This work is needed to compare and choose a best method to estimated the landmarks automatically.
