\chapter{Conclusion}
\indent The landmarks are important characteristic used in shape analysis of many biological and medical application. The method proposed in this thesis can be used to estimate the landmarks on biological image. These estimated landmarks can be compared with the result estimated by cross-correlation.\\[0.2cm]
\indent After finishing the internship, we have done to implement the proposed method by using the OpenCV library and the Qt framework on C++. And the testing was finished on two set of biological images: \textit{right mandible and left mandible}. A feature work could be apply this method on the other dataset of biological images.
